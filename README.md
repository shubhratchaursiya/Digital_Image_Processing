## 💻 Programs Included (With Description)

### 1️⃣ Image Reading and Display  
Reads an input image and displays it in digital format.  
This program demonstrates **basic image input/output operations**.

---

### 2️⃣ Gray Scale Conversion  
Converts a color image into grayscale by processing pixel intensity values.

---

### 3️⃣ Image Negative  
Generates the negative of an image by inverting pixel values.  
Useful for understanding **intensity transformation**.

---

### 4️⃣ Image Enhancement  
Enhances image quality using contrast stretching or similar techniques.

---

### 5️⃣ Image Smoothing (Filtering)  
Reduces noise using smoothing filters such as averaging filters.

---

### 6️⃣ Image Sharpening  
Highlights edges and fine details to make the image clearer.

---

### 7️⃣ Histogram Generation  
Displays the histogram of an image representing pixel intensity distribution.

---

### 8️⃣ Histogram Equalization  
Improves image contrast by redistributing intensity values.

---

### 9️⃣ Edge Detection  
Detects edges in an image using basic edge detection methods.

---

### 🔟 Image Thresholding  
Segments an image by converting it into binary form based on threshold values.

---

## 📤 Output :

Each program generates **visual output images** showing the effect of the applied Digital Image Processing technique.  
The output images help in **understanding how the image changes before and after processing**.
